**What I have Planned for the Future

I plan to work on web development until I feel more comfortable with some of the front and back end technologies I have done some work in. I want to make some websitess and work on web development in some aspect for a while.

I have had some plans for some Raspberry Pi ideas which will likely be published on my GitHub. I have some interest in the area of dev ops which I may expand on at some point.
